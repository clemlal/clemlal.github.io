    "The `numpy` library does some expensive operations outside Python using efficient code (Fortran, C/C++). However, switching back to python after each operation cause a big overhead because of unnecessary copies of the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The library `tensorflow` does all the computations outside of Python: the python API is used to define a graph of operations, that will run entirely using C++ binaries. This architecture allows to get rid of the overhead. Besides, knowing the computational graph beforehand allows to parallelize and/or distribute the computation more easily. As a result, `tensoflow` can run the computations on multiple CPUs or GPUs, and on multiple servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, for quick an easy model prototying, the library `keras` is simpler to use than `tensorflow`. \n",
    "Deep learning models can be constructed thanks to `keras` in few lines of python. So in this notebook, we won't see direct calls to `tensorflow`, but only to `keras`, even if the computations are done by `tensorflow`.\n",

    "For the first part of this tutorial, we will use the [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist) dataset.\n",
    "This dataset contains images representing handwritten digits. \n",
    "Each image is 28 x 28 pixels, and each pixel is represented by a number (gray level). \n",
    "These arrays can be flattened into vectors of 28 x 28 = 784 numbers.\n",
    "You can then see each image as a point in a 784-dimensional vector space. \n",
    "You can find interesting visualisations of this vector space [http://colah.github.io/posts/2014-10-Visualizing-MNIST/](http://colah.github.io/posts/2014-10-Visualizing-MNIST/).\n",

    "## 1.1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The labels in $\\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 9\\}$ giving the digit on the image are be represented using one-hot encoding: labels in $\\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 9\\}$ are replaced by labels in $\\{ 0, 1\\}^{10}$, namely $0$ is replaced by $(1, 0, \\ldots 0)$, $1$ is replaced by $(0, 1, 0, \\ldots 0)$, $2$ is replaced by $(0, 0, 1, 0, \\ldots, 0)$, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, MNIST data is grayscale pixels in $\\{0, \\ldots, 255\\}$. The pixels should be normalized to belong to $[0, 1]$.\n",

    "In practice, increasing the size of hidden layers is not very effective. \n",
    "It is often a better idea to add more layers. \n",
    "Intuitively, if the phenomenon you try to learn has a hierarchical structure, adding more layers can be interpreted as a way to learn more levels of abstraction. \n",
    "For example, if you are trying to recognize objects, it is easier to express shapes from edges and objects from shapes, than to express objects from pixels. \n",

    "In particular cases, such as grid-like data (time series, images), you might want to detect a pattern which can happen in different locations of the data. \n",
    "For example, you try to detect a cat, but the cat can be in the middle or the left of the picture. \n",
    "Thus you need to build a model which is translation invariant: it is easier to learn how to recognize an object independently of its location. \n",

    "### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "When two inputs might contain the same kind of information, then it is useful to share their weights and train the weights jointly for those inputs to learn statistical invariants (things that don't change much on average across time or space). \n",
    "Using this concept on images leads to convolutional neural networks (CNNs), on text, it results on recurrent neural networks (RNNs). \n",
    "When using CNNs, you set weights to a small kernel that will be used to perform a convolution across the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "The image is represented as a 3-dimensional tensor: (width, height, depth). Width and height charecterize the size of the image (eg. 28 x 28 pixels), and depth the color space (e.g. 1 for grey levels, 3 for RGB pictures since each pixel is represented by a triplet $(R,G,B)$).\n",

    "Performing the convolution between the image and the kernel consist to move the kernel across the image, and to produce an output for each patch. \n",
    "The way you move across the image is defined by two parameters:\n",

    "\"Valid\" padding means that you stop at the edge, while \"Same\" padding allows to go off the edge and pad with zeros so that the width and the height of the output and input tensors are the same.\n",

To do so, the weights tensor $W$ should be 3x3x3x32 (in-height, in-width, in-depth, out-depth). \n",
